# Exercise: Types

# What is the data type of the result of: 6 / 2?
print(type(6 / 2)) # Float 3.0 

# What is the type of the result of: 6 // 2? (Note the double slash //.)
print(type(6 // 2)) # Integer 3


# Exercise: Expression

# Let's write an expression that calculates how many hours there are in 160 minutes: 
print(160//60) # this will return the absolute value

print(160/60) # this will return the floating value

# Mathematical expression
print(30 + 2 * 60) # 150

# Mathematical expression
print((30 + 2) * 60) # 1920


# Exercise: Expression and Variables in Python

# What is the value of x where x = 3 + 2 * 2
x = 3 + 2 * 2 
print(x) # 7

# What is the value of y where y = (3 + 2) * 2?
y = (3 + 2) * 2
print(y) # 10

# What is the value of z where 
z = x + y
print(z) # 17
