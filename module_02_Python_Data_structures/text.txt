Tuples
Tuples are a type of data structure in python that are immutable. They are a sequence of various elements in a bracket (1, 2, 'it', 1.4 )

Each element of a tuple can be accessed via an index. 
Each element can be obtained by the name of the tuple followed by a square bracket with the index number:
