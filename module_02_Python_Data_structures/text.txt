Tuples
Tuples are a type of data structure in python that are immutable. They are a sequence of various elements in a bracket (1, 2, 'it', 1.4 )

Each element of a tuple can be accessed via an index. 
Each element can be obtained by the name of the tuple followed by a square bracket with the index number:


Lists
Indexing
We are going to take a look at lists in Python. 
A list is a sequenced collection of different objects such as integers, strings, and even other lists as well. 
The address of each element within a list is called an index. An index is used to access and refer to items within a list.

We can convert a string to a list using split. For example, the method split translates every group of characters separated by a space into an element in a list:


DictionariesÂ¶
What are Dictionaries?

A dictionary consists of keys and values. It is helpful to compare a dictionary to a list. 
Instead of being indexed numerically like a list, dictionaries have keys. 
These keys are the keys that are used to access values within a dictionary.
Each key is separated from its value by a colon ":". Commas separate the items, and the whole dictionary is enclosed in curly braces. 
An empty dictionary without any items is written with just two curly braces, like this "{}".

In summary, like a list, a dictionary holds a sequence of elements. Each element is represented by a key and its corresponding value. 
Dictionaries are created with two curly braces containing keys and values separated by a colon. 
For every key, there can only be one single value, however, multiple keys can hold the same value. 
Keys can only be strings, numbers, or tuples, but values can be any data type.
