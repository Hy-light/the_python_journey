The modules cover the basics of python.

Python is an interpreted language and an Object Oriented Program. Unlike compiled languages which compiles a code before it's execution, python interpretes every line of code during execution. 
The most common object types: strings, integers and floats

------- Errors ------
A syntactic error is when Python does not understand ones code, eg. if one spells 'print' as 'frint'. 
A semantic error is when ones logic is wrong. You may not get an error message but the code could still be wrong.
NameError: is when a function being executed has been wrongly spelt and python is finding it hard to know what it is. It could be a custom or built in function
