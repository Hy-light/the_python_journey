# The_Python_Journey
My python 10 weeks journey started on 5th November, 2024

### 
A syntactic error is when Python does not understand ones code, eg. if one spells 'print' as 'frint'. 
A semantic error is when ones logic is wrong. You may not get an error message but the code could still be wrong.
NameError: is when a function being executed has been wrongly spelt and python is finding it hard to know what it is. It could be a custom or built in function

Python is an interpreted language. Unlike compiled languages which compiles a code before it's execution, python interpretes every line of code during execution
Python us an Object Oriented Program. The most common object types: strings, integers and floats

All issues currently resolved.
