Basics
We create a django project by running the command:

$ django-admin startproject <project-name> # this creates for us the base directories that we need for our project

important files to keep in mind inside the project files include
- settings.py 
- urls.py 
- manage.py 

Run server command 
$ python manage.py runserver # starts the development server within our project

Django works with apps that have their unique set of functionalities, records of installed apps are found in the INSTALLED_APPS variable in the settings,py file

$ python manage.py migrate will help migrate the INSTALLED_APPS and have their data base set up properly

To access the admin centre, we would need to create a super user that can manage our models for us. We do so using this command:
$ python manage.py createsuperuser

To create an app...
$django-admin startapp <app-name>

Every app created must be registered in the settings.py file

It is also adviced to create a urls.py file for every app that you creat

In the views file is where we essentially set up all the functionalities for our backend

Lecture supports app level template over project level templates
Best practice is, app_dir > template, inside templates we create another sub directory with same as app, 
E.g. lynx > templates > lynx ( then every template file )

In your models is where we create the blue print of the things we plan to manage. These things are created using classes. E.g, a car class, a person class, etc.
After defining your models, you will need to prepare migrations using the command:
$ python manage.py makemigrations
Afterwards we then migrate using the command
$ python manage.py migrate # this pushes the models to our data base; we proceed to the admin.py file and register the models
